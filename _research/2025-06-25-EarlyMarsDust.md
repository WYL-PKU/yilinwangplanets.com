title: "Radiative Effect of Dust on the Climate of Early Mars"
collection: research
permalink: /research/earlymarsdust

type: "Project"
venue: School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University
start_date: 2025-06-25
#end_date:
location: Cambridge, MA, US
advisor: Robin Wordsworth
highlights:
    - Calculated key radiative parameters for early Mars dust analogs by applying Mie scattering theory, generating look-up tables for radiative transfer models
    - Integrated custom Mie scattering outputs into the PCM_LBL 1D radiative-convective model to simulate the climatic impact of dust on early Mars
    - Using the theory of reflectance spectroscopy to determine the reflectance spectra of regolith
