title: "Stability of Polar Vortices in Planetary Atmospheres"
collection: research
permalink: /research/pvs

type: "Project"
venue: School of Physics, Peking University
start_date: 2024-01-20
end_date: 2025-09-30
location: Beijing, China
advisor: Tao Cai, Jun Yang
highlights:
    - Analyzed the stability of planetary polar vortices by conducting 3D simulations and linear stability analysis to identify critical conditions leading to vortex splitting
    - Exploring the relationship between vortex instability and atmospheric parameters, with plans to extend the analysis to include various boundary conditions and flow fields
