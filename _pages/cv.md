# Research Experience

### Radiative Effect of Dust on the Climate of Early Mars
  - June 2025 - present
  - Advisor: Professor Robin Wordsworth (Harvard University)
  - Calculated key radiative parameters for early Mars dust analogs by applying Mie scattering theory, generating look-up tables for radiative transfer models
  - Integrated custom Mie scattering outputs into the PCM_LBL 1D radiative-convective model to simulate the climatic impact of dust on early Mars
  - Using the theory of reflectance spectroscopy to determine the reflectance spectra of regolith

### Cloud-Resolving Simulation of Precipitation in Planetary Atmospheres

### Stability of Polar Vortices in Planetary Atmospheres

### Planetary Atmospheric Spectra Retrival based on Machine Learning
