Hi! I am a senior undergraduate student at the School of Physics, Peking University. Since June 2025, I have been working as a visiting undergraduate researcher at School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University.

My research interests include:

- The physical principles that govern planetary climates and their long-term evolution, which I explore using theoretical and numerical models.
- The conditions that lead to planetary habitability and the potential origins of life, both within our Solar System and on exoplanets.

I am now working with [Professor Robin Wordsworth](http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~rwordsworth) on the radiative effect of dust on the climate of early Mars.

For more details on my academic background and projects, please see the navigation bar above.
